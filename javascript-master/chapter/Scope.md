##Scope
In JavaScript, scope is the context in which code is executed.<br/>
typically, scope is used to define the extent of information hidingâ€”that is, <br/>
the **visibility** or **accessibility** of variables from different parts of the program


- global scope
- function scope
- block scope
- lexical scope
- dynamic scope

###global scope
The global scope is the last stop in the **scope chain**,therefore,
Variables defined in the global scope can be accessed from anywhere.<BR/>
**Dangers**: any piece of code can change global variables for any reason at any time


> **Notes**<br/>
> 
> one global scope is used by a JavaScript environment<br/>
> when variable declared,not recommended way that lack `var`


<pre><code>
var g1 =123; // g1 be created in global scope

// global scope
(function(){
    g2 =123; // g be created in global scope
})();
</code></pre>
